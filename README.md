# Travel Management System

## Description

The Travel and Tourism Management System is an online project developed using PHP and MySQL. The purpose of this project is to provide complete information about the vehicles available for a tour. There are two types of users: customers and employees of the travel and tourism agency. 

Customers visit the site and enter the place they wish to travel from and to, as well as the date of their travel. This information is sent to the travel and tourism agency, where an employee checks which vehicles are available for that day and sends a quotation to the customer. If the customer agrees to one of the quotations, they reply with the agreed quotation. The agency then takes down all the details of the customer and sends a confirmation message to the customer. On the day of the tour, the customer must show the confirmation message to the driver before they can start the trip. 

This software is user-friendly and helps customers find vehicles faster than manually searching for them. Before the tour starts, half payment must be made, and the full amount must be paid either in cash or through cards after the customer returns or reaches their destination. Customers can also provide feedback about the travel and tourism agency, which will be taken positively for improvement. Reports are generated periodically, and the database is cleared according to the time span for faster performance.
